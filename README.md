### **Video Game Sales & Player Reviews: What Makes a Good Game?**

## Introduction  
While it may not be obvious to everyone, the video game industry is a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow each year. As technology advances, the gaming industry evolves alongside it. By analyzing not only sales data but also player reviews, this project aims to understand the factors that define a “good” game from the gamers’ perspective. Exploring why certain titles perform better than others—and examining elements such as pricing, genre, marketing, and more—provides valuable insights not only for developers but also for players.

## Motivation  
For my DSA210 project, I’ve chosen a topic that intrigues me: video games. Through this analysis, we can uncover the correlation between raw sales figures and player experience. The findings will inform developers, publishers, and marketers about which factors resonate most with audiences, assist in crafting better games and marketing strategies, and guide players toward titles they’re likely to enjoy.
