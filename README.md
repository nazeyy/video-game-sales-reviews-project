### **Video Game Sales & Player Reviews: What Makes a Good Game?**
As my DSA210 project, I’ve chosen to go with a topic that intrigues me: Video games. While it may not be known by everyone, the video game business is a multi billion dollar industry that continues to grow each year. As technology evolves, the gaming industry evolves with it. By analizing not only the sales data but also the player reviews, this project aims to understand the factors that make a “good” game in the eyes of the gamers. Understanding how and why certain games preform better than others, and the aspects that might be contributing to this performance such as pricing, genre, marketing, and etc. is a valuable insight to not oly the game developers but also for the gamers.

**Data Sources**
Game Sales: Primarily from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/) and possibly other open datasets tracking game sales across various platforms.
Game Reviews: From sources like [OpenCritic](https://opencritic.com/), Reddit discussions, and [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/).
Platform Metadata: Potentially from Steam, Epic Games, and Origin to include additional information such as genres, publishers, and reviews.
